nginx_upstream_jvm_route
-------

This module achieves session stickiness with the session cookie. If the cookie is absent, the module will be a normal Round-Robin upstream module.

INSTALLATION
    
    cd nginx-0.7.59 # or whatever
    patch -p0 < /path/to/this/directory/jvm_route.patch
  
compile nginx with the following addition option:

  --add-module=/path/to/this/directory

EXAMPLE

upstream backend {
    server 192.168.0.100 srun_id=a;
    server 192.168.0.100 srun_id=b;
    server 192.168.0.100 srun_id=c;
    server 192.168.0.100 srun_id=d;

    jvm_route $cookie_JSESSIONID;
}

DIRECTIVES

    jvm_route

    syntax: jvm_route $cookie_COOKIE [reverse]
    default: none
    context: upstream
    description: This directive specifies the session cookie name(0.7.24+). With scanning this cookie, the module will send the request to right backend server. As far as I know, the resin's srun_id name is in the head of cookie. For example, requests with cookie value 'a***' are always sent to the server with the srun_id of 'a'. But tomcat's JSESSIONID is opposite, while the worker name is in the tail of the cookie. The parameter of 'reverse' specifies the cookie scanned from tail to head. 
    

    server

    Every syntax is the same with the official directive except the parameter of 'srun_id' which identified the backend JVM's name by cookie. The default srun_id's value is 'a';
 

Note: This is a third-party module. And you need careful test before using this module in your product environment.
